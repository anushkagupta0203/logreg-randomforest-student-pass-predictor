🎓 Project Overview: Predicting Student Pass/Fail Status
🔍 Problem Statement:
The goal is to build a classification model that predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on various input features such as:

- gender	
- race/ethnicity
- parental level of education
- lunch
- test preparation course
- math score
- reading score
- writing score

🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

🔧 Tools & Libraries
Python

- Pandas, NumPy (data handling)
- Scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, train-test split, metrics)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA and visualizations)

🧪 Workflow Summary

Data Collection – Gathered student performance dataset
Preprocessing – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualized patterns and correlations
Model Building – Trained both Logistic Regression and Random Forest
Evaluation – Compared accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
Conclusion – Selected the best-performing model for final prediction

📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision / Recall / F1-Score
- ROC-AUC (if needed)
